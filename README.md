1. As a person with disabilities I want the intake form to be user-friendly and concise so I won't feel overwhelmed providing information.. - Value = 1

2. As an individual requiring aid for independent living, I want to be able to fill out the patient intake form
   electronically to provide my personal information and medical history. - Value = 1

3. As a caregiver, I want the patient intake form to include emergency contact information for patients, in case
   of medical emergencies. - Value = 1

4. As a caregiver, I want the intake form to have integrated validation system that ensures that all required
   fields are completed before submission. - Value = 1

5. As a caregiver, I want the intake form to present a concise summary for the patient's case. - Value = 1

6. As a provider, I want to receive real-time notifications when a patient is referred to me. - Value = 1
   (i think intake portal does not own this feature, I might be wrong.)
   
7. As a person with language barriers and has a need for multi-language support I want the intake form to be
   available in multiple languages so I can comfortably provide informatiom. - Value = 1

8. As a patient, I want to have the option to save my progress through the patient intake form and return to
   complete it at a later time. Value = 3

9. As a patient, I want the intake form to be customizable so that I can add information records specific to my
   particular case. - Value = 2
 
10. As a patient with color vision deficiency, I want the patient intake portal have an option to change visual themes so that I can traverse the form with ease. - Value = 1

# Rationale: 

We prioritize Story1 because accesibility and experience is extremely crucial, especially for individuals with disabilities, to ensure inclusivity and usability for people from a broad spectrum.

Story 2 addresses the crux of the patient intake portal, allowing users to provide vital information electronically,
facilitating a seamless intake process for those who require aid.

Story 3 is prioritized next since safety and immediate medical care in case of emergencies being critical concerns, should be addressed early in the development process.

Story 4 is up next because data accuracy and completeness are important for providing care to individuals in requirement of aid for achieving independent living.

Story 4 is follwed by Story 5 because, to ensure proper and efficient delivery of care/assistance it is crucial that caregivers are provided with a concise summary of the case.

Story 6 : Prompt communication between the patient and caregiver is vital for seamless patient care delivery making
making this one of the core functionalities. 

Story 7 : Having multilingual support is important for inclusivity for individuals with language barriers, however
it can be implemented after having setup the essential core functionalities.

Story 8 : Offering an option for the users to save and resume their partially filled forms improves usability but
it can be implemented after core features are in place.

Story 9 : Having the option to add custom information records is valuable for tailoring care delivery as per requirements of specific cases, however it can be implemented after core functionalities.

Story 10 : Although important for accessibility, this feature can be addressed after core features because it caters
to a specific/niche group of users.
