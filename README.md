# Far Vision
 Work on improving front-end intake features. Make the interface more visually appealing and add more accessbility features to be more inclusive. Improve the referral system by recommending specialized care plans based on disabilities. 
# Near Vision
 Design an intake form that will gather user information and be connected to the database to store information. Do this through an interface that will allow the users to easily input and submit information. Consider implementing early stage accesibility features for users. Add a document upload feature for medical records or required documents. Work on grouping users based on disabilites to refer them to matching providers.
